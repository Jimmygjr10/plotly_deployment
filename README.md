# plotly_deployment

## Project Overview

In this project I used JavaScript, Plotly.js, Bootstrap, amd HTML to create an interactive dashboard. Dashboards enable organizations to make data easily understandable for users. Dashboard visualizations can help business users identify trends. They can alert to positive trends, isolate negative trends, and offer predictive insights.
